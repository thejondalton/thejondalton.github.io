        <h2>Past</h2>
        <p>I attended Purchase College on a whim. I had a few colleges to choose from but didn&#8217;t put thought into where to go until last minute. It was decision day and picked Purchase College because I figured it wasn&#8217;t important. The problem here was that I was too carefree. It was like this for the entirety of my high school career. While I do think it is important to know how to be relaxed, it is equally as important to know when to take something seriously.
        <br><br> 
I was slacking even when it came to registering for classes for my first semester. I did it carelessly late and many classes that I was interested in were full. After looking through the remaining classes, I found an opening in what would be my first New Media course. The course that scares New Media majors away, Programming for Visual Artists.
<br><br>
I didn’t know what to expect with Programming for Visual Artists, but it would eventually become the most important class of my college experience. It would be a class that I couldn&#8217;t be lazy with. I was learning something entirely new. I had no coding experience prior to this class and at the time I never thought coding would be something I would pursue. It was this fresh start that encouraged me to get involved in class. It wasn&#8217;t the usual class that I was tired of taking in high school. This class helped me get interested more in school in general. I began to put more time and effort into my work. I was a couple weeks into the class and it began to open my mind up to a new medium and helped me understand what New Media was. Not only do I make art, but I also need to understand things on a technological level. This is when I realized that New Media was the major for me. 
Programming also helped me shape my philosophies on art. I began to understand that even if I wasn&#8217;t experienced in programming, that doesn&#8217;t limit my ability to make a good program. If I&#8217;m confident in an idea that utilizes the tools I&#8217;m knowledgeable about, I can make a successful piece of art. I then took this newly found philosophy and would utilize it in my other classes.
<br><br>
Second semester came along and it was my first time taking two foundation courses at the same time. This is where I needed to learn the importance of managing my time, even if it was the hard way. I took Design Principles with Professor Mutiti and this time I had previous experience. I had used illustrator in the past and I was looking forward to expanding my knowledge. This class taught me the importance of composition with design, but more importantly how to articulate myself in class. I was learning how to participate correctly and give critique on the work of my classmates. This was an important skill to learn because it made me teach myself to participate in class without being afraid of saying something incorrect.
<br><br> 
My other foundation course was Intro to Photography with Professor Kim. This is the course that made me realize I had to manage my time better. Doing work last minute was my way to go in high school but the workload from these courses showed me that that&#8217;s not going to work anymore. Admittedly I put photo in the back for the first few weeks and didn’t take it seriously. As time when on it became difficult to complete my photo work when I was prioritizing my design work. I began to approach the classes equally and dedicate equal time on a schedule. If I hadn’t done this I wouldn&#8217;t have realize how much I enjoy making photo collages because I wouldn&#8217;t have put as much time in the homework assignment.
<br><br>
Third semester in and I was taking Intro to Sound with Professor Estok as well as Intro to Web with Professor Singer. Both these classes were touching on topics I had no experience in but at this point that had no effect on me. For the first half of sound I was feeling lost, but I ended up being very proud of my final project for the class. I realized that I was good at the editing and technical portion of sound art so I decided to focus on that for my final. I made a collaborative sound project with my good friend Ammar Karim that tried to recreate dreams that we&#8217;ve had. I believe that this was the final project I had put the most time into.
<br><br>
I was excited to take intro to web the instant I found out it was a class I could take. I wanted to look into web design for a long time but I didn&#8217;t know where to start. I thought this class was interesting because I was taking what I learned from other foundation courses and applying to this one. I enjoyed designing websites so much that I decided it will be a skill I want to further improve when going further in my New Media career and maybe even look for a career in that field.
<br><br>
At this moment in time I&#8217;m taking Video Art I with Professor Magenheimer. While I haven&#8217;t delved too deep into this medium yet, I am excited to learn more about it.
<br><br>
I&#8217;m grateful to have picked new media as my major and to be attending Purchase College to study it. The work and the professors helped mold me into a better student. I learned to become confident in my artwork but I was also able to bring this confidence into my other classes.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>During my New Media experience I found a love for design, programming and editing. I would love to hone in on these skill whenever I get the chance. I want to take more computing classes and I&#8217;m looking into Introduction to Physical Computing: Getting Outside the Box, as well as Mobile Media. I never thought that I would be interested in computer science when I started college, but New Media changed my perspective on it. One day I want to make a phone application, so I want to understand more coding languages other than processing.
  <br><br>
  On top of this, I also want to get into more design courses. Interactive Design and Digital Design and Fabrication are both classes that are close to my interests. During my future in New Media I want to combine my talents in both computing and design. Specializing in both these fields, it is my goal to create interactive media like games, animations and applications. Motion Graphics for Designers and Video Graphics are also classes that I want to take. I don&#8217;t know much about how graphics are made but it is something I definitely want to learn. For the longest time the word, “graphics” seemed so mystical to me and it is excited to know that I can finally learn about them.
  <br><br>
  For my senior project I was thinking about making an interactive program in the form of a Virtual Reality game. This project would have graphics and animations designed by myself and would probably follow a story. Virtual Reality is a topic that  I tackle in my New Media work and having this as a senior project would tie everything together. I feel like the idea of Virtual Reality embodies New Media in a way and in our current time, Virtual Reality is the way of the future for many mediums.</p>
